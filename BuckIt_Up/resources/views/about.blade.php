            BuckIt Up was founded in June of 2015 by three students particpating in Rockit 
            Bootcamp (Phoenix, AZ) as a group project. The goal was to create a site where 
            people could share "BuckIt List" ideas with other people across the world. But 
            even more than that, this site is a place to inspire and motivate people to achieve 
            their dreams.
